To Launch:

This project is launched from the exe file. At present and after building, this file will be present in the bin\debug folder.

Launch the PDFDownloader.exe file. In the windows form use the buttons to select the input excel file, as well the output folder. The names of these are not important, but the formatting for the input excel is! It is expected to follow the coloum name convention set in GRI_2017_2020.xlsx  

Once these files are set, click "run" to execute the PDF copying. Expected runtime for the full 20k entries is about 1.5 hours. A progressbar will give an approcimate indication of the remaining time.

There is very little input sanitation in this file so malformatted input excels will cause horrible crashes.
